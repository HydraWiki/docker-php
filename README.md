Docker PHP
==========
This is an autogenerated PHP client for the [Docker Engine API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/),
built using the [Jane](https://jane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) generator.
 
It aims to replace the abandoned [docker-php/docker-php](https://packagist.org/packages/docker-php/docker-php) package.

Usage
-----
Pass a configured [PSR-18](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18/) HTTP client to the main entry point.
Example for a local Docker instance running on a Unix-like OS, using [php-http/socket-client](https://packagist.org/packages/php-http/socket-client):
```php
$httpClient = new Http\Client\Socket\Client( [
    'remote_socket' => 'unix:///var/run/docker.sock'
] );
$pluginClientFactory = new \Http\Client\Common\PluginClientFactory();
$httpClient = $pluginClientFactory->createClient( $httpClient, [
    new \Http\Client\Common\Plugin\ContentLengthPlugin(),
    new \Http\Client\Common\Plugin\DecoderPlugin(),
    new \Http\Client\Common\Plugin\AddHostPlugin( new \GuzzleHttp\Psr7\Uri( 'http://localhost' ) )
] );

$docker = Docker\Api\Client::create( $httpClient );
```

Updating the code
----
Fetch the new OpenAPI specification YAML from [Docker API docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.40/) and run `composer generate`.
